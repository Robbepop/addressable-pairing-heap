//! An addressable pairing heap implementation for Rust.
//!
//! Addressable heaps return handles to stored elements that make it possible
//! to query and edit them. For example this allows for the `decrease_key(h: Handle)` method
//! that decreases the key (priority) of the element that is associated with the
//! given handle.
//!
//! This implementation stores elements within a `Stash` that allocates elements
//! densely within an array.
//!
//! It is possible to use custom types as the underlying `Key` type by implementing
//! the `Key` trait.
